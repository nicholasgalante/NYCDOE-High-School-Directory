# NYC DOE High School Directory

The NYC DOE High School Directory is a directory containing information about all the high schools in the New York City Department of Education's public school system. 

Users are able to search and filter through a list schools in order to view data on each school such as district number, a link to the school website, contact information, the schoolâ€™s statement, student population, and more.

## Usage

Users can use the search bar to live filter through the directory. Users can search by any key words contained within each school's heading or description. The directory can also be filtered by borough. 

By clicking on each school name and district code, the school card expands to show information about the school.
